Deadlight Edge Platform — Modular, Secure Web + Network Infrastructure
A production-ready, security-hardened edge platform that combines a modular static/dynamic site framework with integrated multi-protocol proxy server management. Built for performance, privacy, and scalability using Cloudflare Workers and lightweight containerized services.

1. Overview
Deadlight Edge Platform is an edge-native application framework that merges:

Blog / CMS Layer – A static-first, markdown-driven content engine with optional dynamic features, deployed at the edge for minimal latency.

Proxy Management Layer – A real-time, multi-protocol proxy server controller with per-session, per-route configuration.

Unified Deployment Pipeline – CI/CD and configuration tooling optimized for Cloudflare Workers and container environments.

Security by Default – Strong isolation between content, application logic, and network-level routing.

The goal: A single, self-hostable stack for high-performance publishing and secure, private network access.

2. Core Features
2.1 Web Layer (Blog / CMS)
Edge-deployed on Cloudflare Workers for global low-latency delivery.

Markdown content system with automatic build/deploy.

Theming via modular components – easily replace or extend UI elements without touching the core.

Asset optimization – CSS/JS bundling, minification, cache-busting, and Cloudflare caching rules.

Optional dynamic endpoints for interactive features.

Security hardening – CSP, sanitization, and Worker-level request filtering.

2.2 Proxy Management Layer
Multi-protocol support (HTTP(S), SOCKS5, WebSocket tunneling).

Dynamic routing rules – per-path, per-origin, or session-based.

Runtime reconfiguration without full service restart.

Access controls – token-based auth, IP restrictions, and encryption.

Logging + monitoring hooks for external observability tools.

Containerized workers for isolated network services.

2.3 Integration Points
Single control interface for content + proxy settings.

Per-route content/proxy blending – e.g., public content + private backend API through the same domain.

Shared secrets + ACLs across layers.

Unified deployment artifacts – one build, one push.

Cloudflare Worker Layer – Handles request routing, caching, content rendering, and API endpoints.

Containerized Proxy Nodes – Run on your infrastructure or remote hosts for flexible exit points.

Control Plane – Configuration stored in Git/JSON/YAML, deployable via CI/CD.

4. Security Model
Zero-trust routing – No implicit trust between layers; all inter-service communication is authenticated.

Worker sandboxing – Cloudflare’s isolation prevents lateral movement in case of compromise.

Secrets management – No secrets hardcoded in repo; stored in environment variables or encrypted vault.

TLS everywhere – Proxy connections encrypted end-to-end.

5. Deployment
Requirements
Node.js v18+
